<p>Scientests conducted experiments on the year 1800 it suggests that humans produced CO2 which gets stuck inside of the atmosphere. By the 1950's CO2 reading rose up which started the global warming theory, not only was the theory proven right but disasteris events could be leading up to it. </p>

            <li>Instead of using plastic that only 4-5% will get recycled we can use eco friendly bags, straws ect.</li>&nbsp;
            <li>we can try useing diffrent type of fule like Solar, wind, hydroelectric, biomass, and geothermal power instead of fosil fule which produces a lot of co2 affecting the earths atmosphere over time.</li>&nbsp;
            <li>One huge thing that affects the atmosphere and not many people know about is cow farms. If you didnt know cows were meant to eat grass which would be compleatly healthy and natural for them. what isnt healthy and natural is all the food and hormones the factories give to these cows. which makes them gassy making a single cow produce 220 pounds of methade which affects the atmosphere 28 times more than co2.</li>&nbsp;
